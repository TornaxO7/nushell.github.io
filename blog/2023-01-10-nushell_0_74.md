# Nushell 0.74

Nushell, or Nu for short, is a new shell that takes a modern, structured approach to your command line. It works seamlessly with the data from your filesystem, operating system, and a growing number of file formats to make it easy to build powerful command line pipelines.

Today, we're releasing version 0.74 of Nu. This release includes many command refinements.

# Where to get it

Nu 0.74 is available as [pre-built binaries](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/releases/tag/0.74.0) or from [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/nu). If you have Rust installed you can install it using `cargo install nu`.

NOTE: The optional dataframe functionality is available by `cargo install nu --features=dataframe`.

As part of this release, we also publish a set of optional plugins you can install and use with Nu. To install, use `cargo install nu_plugin_<plugin name>`.

# Themes of this release / New features

## Signature fall-through for flags resolves problems around external command definitions ([kubouch](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/7527))

Also `exec`

## `values` command to programmatically interact with records ([webbedspace](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/7583))

```sh
>  {a: "Happy", b: "new", c: "year"} | values
╭───┬───────╮
│ 0 │ Happy │
│ 1 │ new   │
│ 2 │ year  │
╰───┴───────╯
```

## MIME-types are supported in `ls` with an additional flag. ([fdncred](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/7616))

To find out what applications your operating system associates with particular files you can now use the `--mime-type` or `-m` flag on our `ls` command.
This simplifies filtering for particular files and can help you dispatch files to particular programs. 
When opening files with nushell directly `open` will still follow the same heuristics using file endings and the built-in `from ...` command parsers.

## Regular expression queries are cached for performance ([rgwood](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/7587))

## All built-in commands now declare their pipeline input and output types ([sholderbach](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/7532))

A few releases back commands internally got the capability to declare not only the types of parameters but also pairs for the input and output on the pipeline.
With this release we finally declare those input and output types for all core nushell commands. 
This can help you as user to see what a command expects from the pipeline and might return.
We are exploring how nushell can leverage that for more useful diagnostics and completions. In the future we may introduce syntax for user-defined commands to declare their input and output types explicitly.

# Breaking changes

- `columns` will now error for data that is not a table or a record ([#7593](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/7593))
- The dataframe specific command `fill-na` has been renamed to `fill-nan` to better represent its capabilities ([#7565](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/7565))
- The requirements for the names of a nu command and a command alias have been tightened to avoid some problems ([#7392](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/7392))
- `to toml` will only produce output for records now as the output for tables is ambiguous and may be invalid to parse ([#7597](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/7597))
